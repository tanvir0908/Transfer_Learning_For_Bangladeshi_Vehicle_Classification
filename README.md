Bangladesh Has different kinds and large number
of vehicles. To classify them correctly it needs to have a good
data set and classification algorithm. In this project we proposed to
use different Transfer Learning models to classify them correctly.
Transfer learning uses its previous knowledge to solve the current
one. By using different Transfer Learning models we are able to
classify different vehicles and also we compare them that which
model can give more accurate result. In this project
where I used different variations of Transfer
Learning Models like VGG16, ResNet152V2,
DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB7 in a large
dataset called ParibahanBD.
