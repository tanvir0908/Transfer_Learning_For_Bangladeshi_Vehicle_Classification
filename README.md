Bangladesh Has different kinds and large number
of vehicles. To classify them correctly it needs to have a good
data set and classification algorithm. In this paper we proposed to
use different Transfer Learning models to classify them correctly.
Transfer learning uses its previous knowledge to solve the current
one. By using different Transfer Learning models we are able to
classify different vehicles and also we compare them that which
model can give more accurate result.
